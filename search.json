    "section": "3.3 Specific challenges",
    "text": "3.3 Specific challenges\n\n3.3.1 Opening code without exposing data/‘secrets’\nIn coding terms exposing secrets often mean sharing passwords or keys but for the data analysis that occurs in the NHS and other public sector organisations, this will also mean the sharing of personal, clinical or other sensitive data. In practice there are a number of approaches to avoiding this happening, see the specific NHS approaches:\n\nNHSx Open Source Policy[-@nhsx_osp] (note NHSx is now NHS England but this hasn’t been adopted as an NHS England Policy),\nNHS England’s R Reporting[-@nhse_report] and\nCDU Data Science Team blogs about GitHub[-@cdu]\nMaking source code open and reusable[-@gds-open] (provides broad requirements like storing secret keys and credentials separately)\n\nand these include setting up repositories so there are automated restrictions to prevent and reduce the risk of unintentional disclosure of any sensitive data.\nNevertheless, we do have to rely upon people using these recommendations and setting up their systems which is very similar to our use of email or social media accounts. As an example, with email we need to rely upon senders using the blind copy in email if the recipients include patients or the public as there is no automated way to prevent a breach of emails otherwise. Consequently, mistakes have and do happen and there are mechanisms which are in place to report these breaches and does not mean that we prevent people from using email or social media. Systems like GitHub do offer the possibility to set up processes to prevent, reverse and delete accidental sharing (breaches) but are still subject to reporting for near misses and incidents when these occur. However, it may be that these are only reported locally and do not, currently, get shared more widely.\n\n\n3.3.2 Opening code without giving away commercial/business/clinical proprietary information (and Intellectual Property)\nThe issue of intellectual property is a very difficult one to argue against, particularly when analysts and data scientists are not necessarily trained or familiar in this area of law. However, it is often used as a reason why not to share specific code, like SQL, but without any formal detail as to how this will be breaking any laws. By publishing SQL code it is often assumed that the structure of the databases, which is owned by a company, could be inadvertently revealed. However, there are examples of clinical database schemas like that of TPP who own SystmOne and which has been shared as part of the OpenSafely secure analytics platform for NHS electronic health records and it could be said that discussions related to sharing code should be considered as part of the procurement process. And also Government guidance, When code should be open or closed, from the Central Digital & Data Office states:\n\nUnless your database schema contains credentials it is not sensitive and can be open. You should store any credentials separately and keep them closed.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Coding in the open\nThere is, currently, no one policy or procedure that can be referred to in terms of coding in the open. Whilst it has been recommended strongly in many of the important reviews available to the NHS like Data Saves Lives -@data-saves-lives] and Goldacre Review[-@goldacre_2022] there continues to be little guidance on what this looks like in day to day work. Some teams have published in the open, like the CDU Data Science Team [-@cdu] and features as a case study example, however, the team has changed in approach and name as of 2023 and the blog site is no longer being updated. The NHSx Open Source policy[-@nhsx_osp] recommended that all development/analytics work done in the NHS be coded in the open unless there is good reason not to. However, NHSx moved into NHS England in 2022 and the GitHub repository (where this is published) and continues to state:\n\nCurrent status: Version 1.0 - This policy is currently going through internal review as part of the adoption process.\n\nIt is worth noting, in terms of open coding, this document also says:\n\nAn internal code review should be conducted for all open source projects and specific responsibilities must be met within or close to the development team.\n\nReviews could be deemed to slow the process of sharing code openly and so needs to be considered within the context of software code maintenance which is a subject in itself. Books on code review principles from the Tidyteam at Posit can be a really good place to start.\nThe Making source code open and reusable[-@gds-open] suggests making your code open from the start and gives a short check list on what to consider when making existing code open."

The reference to a digital playbook where the requirement is to:\n\ncreate a project that can be used by other healthcare organisations\n\nlinks to case study scenarios which may have information, but which will require reading through to check and reference. One site that is listed is the CDU Data Science Team[-@cdu] and whilst this team used licences there was never any explicit mention on how or when to use them.\nGovernment documents like the Duck book[-@duck] do have sections on copyright and licenses and their recommendations, along with the Analysis Function, are to use MIT and OGL.\nThe Making source code open and reusable[-@gds-open] states:\n\nYou should publish your code under an Open Source Initiative compatible licence. For example, GDS uses the MIT licence.\n\n\nAll code produced by civil servants is automatically covered by Crown Copyright.\n\nHowever, many people who are part of the NHS-R Community are not considered civil servants:\n\n… civil servants are defined much more narrowly than public sector workers: police, teachers, NHS staff, members of the armed forces and local government officers are not counted as civil servants.\n\nEven where a person’s work is covered by being a civil servant, it is still really good practice to include the corresponding licence to any published work as it cannot be assumed that people know the work is covered by the licence or that the person was a civil servant.\nAlso, whilst some organisations in the NHS are considered Crown bodies like the Department of Health:\n\nSubsection (7) provides that, like NHS trusts, NHS foundation trusts are not Crown bodies: see paragraph 18 of Schedule 2 to the National Health Service and Community Care Act 1990 (“the 1990 Act”).\n\nHealth and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 Explanatory Notes.)\n\n\n3.4.3 NHS-R Community use of licences\nThe use of licences by NHS-R Community for the GitHub repositories will be detailed in the NHSR-Way book under Style Guide for code.\n\n\n3.4.4 Setting up licenses\nThere are two ways to starting a repository for sharing on GitHub. Firstly, there is creating a repository directly on the GitHub website and you can select the appropriate licence as you do that.\nIf, however, you create the project locally, using R for example, you can add a licence to it using a package called {usethis} and typing in the R console:\nusethis::use_cc0_license()\nusethis::use_mit_license()\nOGL though does not appear in the selections for {usethis} or GitHub. Crown Copyright sometimes appears as a separate licence as in the {a11ytables} and sometimes combined as in pay-aminusers, an example referred to in the GDS Way.\nDual licences, like MIT and CC0 are not so commonly combined and there is more information on the GitHub site about dual licensing."

    "text": "4.1 About this chapter\nThis chapter elaborates what is required to make R viable in practice. R is a powerful language for statistical work and other kinds of data analysis. Much of this power comes from the way that R fits together with two important helpers: R Studio and R packages. This chapter describes the way that R, R Studio, and R packages work together in non-technical language. Our aim in writing this simple introduction is to provide a useful resource to leaders within the NHS and other organisations in health and care who wish to support and encourage the use of R in their practice. Our motive in writing this chapter is to overcome the institutional reluctance that is often encountered when trying to use new open-source tools. For many years we have had guidance that open source programs should be encouraged. Yet open source tools are frequently identified as security or information governance risks by organisations. We think that these concerns are largely the result of confusion about the nature of open source tools. This chapter is therefore aimed at clearing up some of this confusion, by providing a simple, non-technical, and focused introduction to the tools that are an integral part of R.\nAlthough the current focus of this chapter is specific to R and its tools, we note that similar situations are found in many other languages and programmes. We discuss this below in the section Why not include all this useful code in R?. As the NHS-R Community matures we may extend this learning to cover other open-source tools such as Python.\n\n4.1.1 Some use cases for this chapter\n\nTo provide guidance to Information Governance (IG) practitioners who have been asked to evaluate the use of R in some health and care context\nTo provide reassurance and explanation to collegues and managers when R is being considered for use in some project\nTo support those new to R in understanding how the many packages and tools fit together"

    "text": "4.2 Introduction\nR uses packages. Packages are small, reusable packages of code that allow users to create and use new functions. These packages can be easily distributed so that users can adopt them in the code that they are writing. To illustrate, imagine that you run into a tricky problem programming problem. We can think of three different ways of solving this problem:\n\nWrite all-new code from scratch\nCopy-paste working code from somewhere else\nUse a package\n\nThe traditional approach might be to solve the problem by writing completely new code from scratch. And sometimes writing original code is the best way to solve problems, particularly if those problems are very unusual.\nOften though the problems that we encounter are not at all unusual. Commonly encountered problems are, by definition, the kind of problems that we would most often encounter. We give an example below about times and dates, which frequently cause problems for programmers.\nWriting a completely original solution each time we encounter a common problem seems inefficient. So it is no surprise that code reuse is common practice across the field. The scale of websites dedicated to sharing useful code (like stack overflow) is testament to the deep sense of professional loathing that many programmers have for inefficiency in their work.\nBut finding and sharing reliable code to solve common problems comes with difficulties of its own. You could look for solutions online, and then copy and paste any promising code chunks into your project. While generally quicker and easier than writing new code from scratch, copying code manually requires a surprisingly high degree of skill. Both an expert’s eye for assessing possible solutions, and the skills to appropriately adjust borrowed code to fit the requirements of your project are needed.\nPackages are a way of standardising and sharing useful code. Rather than copying and adjusting a block of code, you simply add the package to your programme. You can then use the new functions contained in the package as if you had written them yourself. They are a consistent way to extend the functions available to user. Many programming languages use packages (or libraries) in a similar way. Python is a good example, where many useful functions are done using third-party packages.\nPackages make R better: easier to use and learn, more flexible, and with richer options for analysis. They are a feature and not a bug, and for many users their work in R utterly depends on packages."

    "text": "4.3 What is inside a package?\n\n“In R, the fundamental unit of shareable code is the package. A package bundles together code, data, documentation, and tests, and is easy to share with others.” Wickham and Bryan, 2019. R packages: Organize, Test, Document and Share Your Code\n\nTo illustrate, we can show the code from two related NHS-R packages: NHSRplotthedots (CRAN) and NHSRdatasets (CRAN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent\nPurpose\nExample\n\n\n\n\nCode\nAllows the user to use functions in their own code\n  the code for the ptd_spc function used to create SPC charts\n\n\nData\nDemonstrates the function(s), training new users\n  sample of NHSR dataset linked to NHSRplotthedots\n\n\nDocumentation\nUser guides, package vignettes and other documentation\n  documentation for the ptd_spc function\n\n\n\nAnd we can usually find at least three of these components in most R packages (tests are a bit more elusive, and are less commonly encountered). It’s also worth noting that the data included in community packages is sample data or open data that is really meant to help users experiment with the new functions in a package. It’s definitely not standard practice to share real data for analysis in this way. Lots of these standard datasets built into packages - like mtcars - are used over and over again as ways of demonstrating R functions.\nIf you’re writing a package, we would encourage caution as to the data that you include. We won’t provide detailed guidance here on what’s okay to include in your package. But would be useful to remind package authors that the proper oversight should be carried out before sharing any data as part of your package."

    "text": "4.4 Why not include all this useful code in R?\nCall the approach that R takes modular. R provides some core functions, but users are able to add modules (packages) that change the functions that are available. It’s like being able to customize the tools that you use to work on each project.\nUsers coming to R from software that does not work like this can find this modular approach messy and odd. If you’ve grown up working in Microsoft Excel, then you will be accustomed to doing almost any task using just the build-in functions in the core software. For that user, switching to an environment where the user has to select and add small, specific, tools to achieve things can feel rather alien. And this difference has deep roots, representing a deep difference in software engineering philosophy. R broadly follows a UNIX-like small tools approach as a way of managing and reducing the complexity of computer systems. As Eric Raymond put it, this is one of the central rules of the UNIX philosophy:\n\n\nRule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces. Raymond 2003 The Art of UNIX Progamming\n\n\nAnother reason: each project written in R is different. Isn’t it great to be able to select just the right tools needed to do the job properly? On this, you can find a list of some of the packages that the NHS-R community find particularly useful at https://github.com/nhs-r-community/awesome-nhsr."

    "section": "4.5 Where do you find packages?",
    "text": "4.5 Where do you find packages?\nThe recognised global repository for R packages is called CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network). R packages must pass through a strict system of checks across multiple platforms if they’re to be accepted into CRAN. Acceptance is a sign of quality and a protective measure that helps ensure that packages meet minimum standards. It also provides extra assurance to business IT teams that the packages are ‘safe’ for use.\nThe power of packages is reflected in the number of them that are available. CRAN currently lists a total of 18872 packages. Adding and updating packages is one of the ways that R keeps developing. Many community groups - including NHS-R - have produced packages to do useful things for their work. And these packages are freely available to the community.\nThat community spirit is an important part of the open software movement. We think that sharing useful code in an open way is important. Governments too think similarly. For example, see the requirement to make new code open source from NHS England digital openness and similar from ScotGov. The recent Goldacre review (2022) comes to similar conclusions:\n\nLibraries Useful functions often outgrow individual projects and build a broader user-base, especially when a large number of users are all trying to solve the same suite of related problems, with a range of related functions. When this happens, more experienced programmers move the work into reusable code ‘libraries’ and share them through package indexes or archive networks. The process of creating and sharing libraries can improve the quality of code, because work that is more widely used is likely to be more widely reviewed. Popular libraries tend to be well documented and come with clear explanations and examples, which decrease the barriers to entry for inexperienced coders: when more people use the work, more people invest in improving it. By creating and sharing a library, researchers contribute to the broader research community. This more advanced variety of code sharing is common in many areas of scientific research, such as Geographic Information Science, but it is less common at present in health data research.\n\nBetter, broader, safer: using health data for research and analysis\nWe believe that this approach is safe, and are not aware of any data protection issues that have arisen because of the use of packages in R."

For example, there are lots of ways of storing and representing dates. There are also many inconsistencies - 24 hours in a day but 60 seconds in a minute, leap years, different numbers of days in months, time zones, and so on.\nMany analysts use an R package called lubridate to help manage dates and times. This package has lots of helpful functions for parsing, calculating, and representing dates and times. For example, imagine that you want to calculate the number of seconds between two dates. For simple cases, that’s not too hard to do in base R. But what if some of your time values cross time zones? What if clock time has changed (say, due to daylight savings) during that interval? The functions in the {lubridate} package allow analysts to ignore some of this complexity, meaning that they don’t need to write many lines of code in order to accommodate time zones each time they want to do a simple duration calculation."

This can cause difficulties, particularly when risk management practices often assume that a programme is a broadly stable lump of functions, rather than a loose coalition of packages. To identify of this issues that we have encountered:\n\nPackages present a moving target for information governance. How can we assess the risk of something that is always liable to change? Our response to this: consider the system (R, RStudio, and packages) as the correct unit of analysis. Because packages are so widely used, it does not make sense to carry out information governance assessments of R by itself.\nThere are so many packages (c.19k packages on CRAN), and there are several different sources for packages. How can we be sure that they are all safe? Our response to this is to point to community standards for packages. For example, CRAN carries out oversight on submitted packages, which have to meet certain standards. This precludes some worries about what might be lurking in a hypothetical package. It is also worth saying that we are aware of no cases where R packages have lead to security problems for users.\nPackages contain data, and therefore need data protection impact assessment. As discussed above, the data in R packages is used for testing, training, and demonstration purposes only, and isn’t a method for sharing live data between users.\nHow can free software be trustworthy? Isn’t there going to be a catch? And who is responsible for ensuring the quality and safety of this software? Free open-source software (FOSS) is now widely used across sectors. Useful comments in FAQ section of HSMA site:\n\n\nIt is also important to highlight that all software has potential vulnerabilities, including the proprietary software that you already have installed. Therefore, good software security practices should be maintained regardless of the software you are using."

So it is perhaps odd that, while we allow a doctor to conduct surgery only after years of training, we give SPSS® (SPSS, Chicago, IL) to almost anyone. Moreover, whilst only a surgeon would comment on surgical technique, it seems that anybody, regardless of statistical training, feels confident about commenting on statistical data.\n\n@vickers_interpreting_2005\nThe NHS, as one of the largest hospital and healthcare systems, is a world leader in research. Research and evaluation are carried out as funded projects as well as unfunded audits/ evaluation. Both of which often require statistics- the analysis often being done in SPSS/ SAS or Excel. These methods can produce flawed analyses which, moreover, are not reproducible.\nMany trusts do not employ statistics experts and will only be able to get statistical help on funded work by buying in time from academic/external statisticians. This means that the pilot work that clinicians do prior to applying for large grants can often be flawed, or promising work ends up not being completed and the grants never awarded because they didn’t have the statistics expertise.\nWhile we would not expect clinicians to become expert coders, the NHS-R community should work to develop and deliver training that would help clinicians to be able to use R, including the development of training specifically for those with a clinical/ non coding background. This training needs to include R for statistics as well as the more commonly included data wrangling and visualisation.\nBetter collaboration between R users working in academia and those in the NHS would also be beneficial."

    "text": "5.4 Events\nNHS-R already has a very successful conference but in the workshop there was a suggestion that there could be another NHS-R event focused on finding problems and solutions to them. There are several ways this could usefully be done, perhaps as a hackathon type approach where the problems are begun on during the event (finished during the event if there is time or worked on afterwards), or more of a problem definition/ alliance building type approach where the actual problems and the people who are interested in solving them are identified during the event and then the actual development is done later."

    "text": "5.5 Appendix A: workshop\nThe following summarises a workshop about the future of NHS-R.\n\n5.5.1 How has the NHS-R Community contributed to the system thus far?\nThe positive contribution of the NHS-R Community was shared by all stakeholders and included the following highlights. For analysts: a safe, trusted, supportive space to learn and share together, a badge of honour, joy, confidence, upskilling, networking, working across organisational boundaries without needing permission. For leaders: signposting to a trusted brand and community that can influence policy which is underpinned by two value systems - NHS and open source. For the wider system: NHS-R has shifted thinking on how to secure analytic needs in the future and is perhaps the world’s first open-source community focused on health and care with admirers across the globe.\n\n\n5.5.2 What is the need in the system given the change in the health and care landscape?\nThe system has evolved, and progress has been made since the NHS-R Community was established. Still, some common themes persist regarding the needs of the system; skills gaps, infrastructure needs, better collaborative working and more structured peer learning, and the development of analytical leadership. Specific examples include: methodological training for analysts, setting professional standards, equipping leaders with analytical thinking skills, supporting the use of operations research methods, building links with social care and researchers, quality assurance processes and more. There was consensus that the NHS-R Community should focus on its strengths and not duplicate or drift from this because this may undermine its impact (perhaps because it becomes less relevant to its core members who are flourishing in the freedom of NHS-R).\nBelow is a summary of what the “NHS-R Community” can do to support the system.\n\n\n5.5.3 What can the NHS-R Community do to support the system?\nThe following areas were identified. 1. Engage with NHS leaders to help them appreciate the potential of the NHS-R Community as a resource. 2. Work with NHSD/Transformation Directorate to remove barriers/create resources for IT departments to make open source tools readily available for analysts. 3. Provide an ‘Ask us’ hub where leaders and analysts can refer their questions or issues so that they can get a “grass roots” view from the NHS-R Community on how these might be best addressed. 4. Scaling local solutions nationally and vice-versa 5. Myth busting on “open-source” analytics including addressing security and information governance concerns. 6. Increased collaboration with national bodies such as NHS Transformation Directorate. 7. Set up an NHS Data Science Event (say over 3 to 5 days) for the NHS to identify common problems and develop shared solutions.\n\n\n5.5.4 We asked a pre-mortem question - imagine the NHS-R Community has died, what led to its demise?\nThe following were identified.\n\nThe NHS-R Community was too reliant on volunteers who were unable to sustain their input.\nThe NHS-R Community lost its values and was no longer a brand that was seen as safe, trusted, welcoming, especially to newbies.\nThe NHS-R Community got too pre-occupied with contributing to the centre and so lost touch with grass roots analysts.\nNational data science teams/bodies did not feel as if they had a stake in the NHS-R Community and so disengaged with it and could not see its relevance.\nR lost out to Python or some other open data science tool.\nThe NHS-R Community did not offer enough “attractors” to analysts (eg wider training, support, development opportunities, etc).\nThe NHS-R Community did not have adequate funds to continue to support it.\nThe NHS-R Community lost its central organising team and so disintegrated.\n\nThis should inform our approach to risk over the coming years. We should focus on resilience, being forward thinking and responsive, maintaining our values, broadening the organising team, actively seeking & cultivating new members, and finding funding solutions and partners that can support our activities."
